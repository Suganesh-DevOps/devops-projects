üö® Scenario 1: Pod Stuck in CrashLoopBackOff
Question:
Your pod web-app is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff state. How do you troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

Expected Actions:

Check pod status: kubectl get pod web-app

Describe pod: kubectl describe pod web-app

View logs: kubectl logs web-app

Check for readiness/liveness probe failures or misconfigured command

Look for out-of-memory (OOMKilled) in events or container status

‚ö†Ô∏è Scenario 2: Pod in Pending State
Question:
Your pod is in a Pending state for over 10 minutes. What could be the reason and how do you resolve it?

Expected Actions:

Check pod: kubectl describe pod <pod>

Common reasons:

No matching node (e.g., due to nodeSelector, taints)

Resource requests too high (e.g., requesting 32 CPUs)

No nodes in Ready state

Check node resources: kubectl describe node, kubectl top node

‚ùå Scenario 3: Container Image Pull Failure
Question:
Your pod is not starting and shows ImagePullBackOff. What steps would you take?

Expected Actions:

Describe pod: kubectl describe pod <pod>

Look for image pull error in Events section

Check:

Image name/tag correctness

Private registry access (need secret?)

DockerHub rate limit hit?

Use: kubectl create secret docker-registry for private image auth

üì∂ Scenario 4: Readiness Probe Failing
Question:
A pod is running but traffic is not routed to it. You find the readiness probe is failing. How do you debug?

Expected Actions:

Describe pod to inspect readiness probe config

Check logs: kubectl logs <pod>

Try curl from inside pod: kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl localhost:<port>

Validate that the app starts but does not expose the expected endpoint

üí£ Scenario 5: OOMKilled Containers
Question:
One of your containers keeps getting killed and restarting. How would you identify if it's due to memory?

Expected Actions:

Describe pod: kubectl describe pod <pod>

Look at container state:

lastState.terminated.reason: OOMKilled

Check container resource limits: resources.limits.memory

Solution: Increase memory limit or fix app memory leak

üîí Scenario 6: Pod Cannot Access External Internet
Question:
Your application pod can't connect to the internet (e.g., calling an API or downloading a package). What would you check?

Expected Actions:

Exec into pod and run: curl, ping, nslookup

Check if DNS resolution is working
