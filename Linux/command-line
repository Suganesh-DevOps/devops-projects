----Archive file & 🤐 zipping-------
tar --> tape archive
bundles multiple files and directories into one single archive file — without compressing them by default.

tar -cf "filename"  " " " " --> to create a tar file
tar -xf "filename" --> to extract a tar file
tar -xvzf "filename" " "  " " --> Combining files and compressing

zipping is take in place to compress the file size into smaller size for better performance either for downloading or uploading a file content.

various zipping utiliities are
--> gzip
--> bzip2
--> xz
--> zip
--> tar ( along with z for gzip
          j for bzip2
          J for xz )
