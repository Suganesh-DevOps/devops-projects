
Before getting into know other stuff please understand the very basics
1. What is Network ?
A network is a group of two or more connected devices (like computers, servers, phones, printers) 
 simply --> A network connects devices locally, for example 
2. What is Internet ?
The Internet is a global network of computers that are connected together to communicate, share information, and access services.
 simply --> the Internet connects millions of networks globally.
--IP--
IP --> Internet protocal address
Types of IP address
   1. IPV4
   2. IPV6

 IPV4
   it is a 32 bit numeric address and separted by dot
   176.8.122.2 --> each numer is a byte tottaly 4 bytes.
              Why it is only 4 bytes ?
              It is because of IPV4 protocal when they designed
  

--Subnet--
Dividing larger newwork into  smaller part
   What is the use ?
     1. security
     2. privacy
     3. To reduce IP address waste

     Every IP address has 
         1. newwork part (To identify to which network it is belongs to)
         2. Host part (to identify the Host)
    Subnet adds more bits on network part --> which means {{172.62}.2}.8 -->  {{172.62}.2} this is network part --> .8 for host part
     so that we can create a range of servers as per of need.
     This all can be done using (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) --> CIDR

How to trouble shoot the network connectivity in a linux server ?

using "ip addr"
it will show like below when u run the above command
root@DESKTOP-BA3EH26:~# ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet 10.255.255.254/32 brd 10.255.255.254 scope global lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:15:5d:a5:32:0d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.25.71.146/20 brd 172.25.79.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fea5:320d/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
	   
	   in this
	      - LOOPBACK is used for internal communication of a system
		  - eth0 is the 1st level of network interface.
		  
		  to show the particular network interface --> ip addr show eth0
		                                               ip add show lo
 how to troubleshoot incase eth0 is down ?
 eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,DOwN,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    sudo ifconfig eth0 up --> to make it up..
	if then also not comming up means try restaring the eth0 network interface.
	- restart
	sudo ifdown eth0
	sudo ifup eth0
	
	- for force restart
	sudo ifdown --force eth0
    sudo ifup --force eth0
     
    - how to request a IP for eth0 if does not have one means
	  sudo dhclient eth0
	  
    - How to check the default route in system
	  ip route
	  it should contain default gateway to communicate outside network
	 
	- traceroute
      Displays the route packets take to reach a destination, showing each hop along the way.


--PORTS--
A port is a 16-bit number (ranging from 0 to 65535)
   "ss tuln"
	t - TCP
	u - UDP
	L - Listnening 
	n - Show numeric addresses
	
	to check which service/process using a specific port
	"sudo lsof -i :22"
	lsof will print all of the available port. 
	
	How to allow a port to access. for example
	
	sudo ufw enable "port"
	sudo ufw deny "port"
